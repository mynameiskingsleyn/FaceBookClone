		Paused == >
Lesson 12(Setup Routes)
	Here we are creating routes folder and require route
	import route file and have app.use(required_file)
	Using readdirSync … We use this to read whats inside directory
	import  ==> const { readdirSync } = require("fs");
		then we can do readdirSync(‘./dirname’); this will return array of files.

Lesson 15(Env)
	We need to install the env package to use this.
	installation ==> npm i dotenv  
	Usage
		const dotenv = require(“dotenv”)
		dotenv.config();
		Now all we need to do is use process.env to access the env.
		e.g => const PORT = process.env.port
Lesson 17 (Create Mongo DB account and set up)
	we need to install MongoDB Compass . (on our computer)will make our life extremely easy.
	We need to install mongodb and mongoose (this will help us work with the mongodb )
		install ->  npm i mongodb mongoose  
			run npm audit fix (to fix some changes) 
	PAUSE ======>>>

Lesson 19(Working with JSON and Explaining HTTP response)
	To use Json we need to add to our main file(server.js)

Lesson 25( Setup Google OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs)
	email —> soulmater@gmail.com
	We need google cloud console. 
	I will have to use mailtrap to test this.
	Creating project in google console.cloud
		==>https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/credentials?authuser=1&supportedpurview=project
		project name = facebookmailing
		==> we select project
		go to menu on left .
		select APIs & services > OAuth consent screen
		click on “Create”
		App name ==> facebookmailing
		user support email ==> soulmater.com@gmail.com

		save!!
		Go back to menu >> credentials 
		Click on +CREATE CREDENTIALS on the top
			select => create OAuth client ID.
			select application type = Web application
			type in name ==> facebookmailer
		Authorized javascript origins => our url => http://localhost:3000
		Authorized redirect urls ==> https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
		then create!! 
		this will create a pop up window with credentials==> we copy the client id and client secret and save to our env file 
 		now we go back to the google developer play ground ==> https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
	Google developer play ground ==> https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
		here we go to “options” and the right > select “use your own OAuth credentials
		we add our credentials in the respective blocks(this is os that the oath don’t keep changing every often) and close
		In other words, we needed to create our application and generate this so that our Oauth don’t keep changing.
		we go to Authorize Api and add ==> https//mail.google.com
		then follow instruction to the next stage ==> here we get the Authorization code: 
		select “Exchange authorization code for tokens”

		nodemailer ==> npm i nodemailer 
		googleapis ==> npm i googleapis 
		Creating temp email —> just create a simple “filename.html” 
			we add extension to ‘visual code’ name ‘html-live server’
			also we use the “HTML compressor” to compress the file to put on our application directory
		Testing mail ==> google (temp mail) ==> https://temp-mail.org/en/ 
			very good for testing…

	install the router ==> npm i react-router-dom 
	
	Remember the application we added on the extension ==> now in a file, we can just type “rfc” to create a real functional component.
		gives us a snippet
	Routes looks much different at this point. using element instead of component
	<Routes>
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} exact/>
          <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
